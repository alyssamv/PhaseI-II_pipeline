# Simulation of drug development pipeline from phase I to phase II
This project was presented at the SCT 42nd Annual Meeting in May 2021. Slides are provided here.

The aims are to assess the consequences of drug and phase I design characteristicson phase II trial outcomes.

Three phase I designs are used:
* 3+3
* CRM
* EffTox

Five dose-response scenarios are included:
* Monotonically increased
* Flat
* Plateau
* Concave
* Monotonically decreasing

Null (ineffective drugs) and alternative (effective drug) setting are both simulated, where the probability of the drug being effective is 0.2.
