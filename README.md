# PhaseI-II_pipeline

The code here simulates a partial drug development pipeline, from phase I to phase II. 

Three phase I designs are used:
* 3+3
* CRM
* EffTox

Five dose-response scenarios are included:
* Monotonically increased
* Flat
* Plateau
* Concave
* Monotonically decreasing

Null (ineffective drugs) and alternative (effective drug) setting are both simulated, where the probability of the drug being effective is 0.2.
